<h1>Always Remember, Empires Never Last</h1>

<p><img src="../pics/galahad.jpg" alt="Empires Never Last , Galahad"  style="width:100%;height:auto;max-width:800px" /></p>

<p>(This was supposed to be finished on October 12, 2025)</p>

<p>For the last two weeks, students in KNTU ( My uni ) primarily consisting of dormitory residents in
Danesh 1 &amp; Danesh 2 Dormitories, have been protesting once every night.</p>

<p>Their main concern? Criticizing The absolute mess KNTU is in right now.</p>

<h2>Logistical Mess</h2>

<p>For those of you don&rsquo;t know the university is not centralized in a specific place,
it is actually spread across different regions of Tehran. While most ( not all ) of dormitories are
centralized close to only one or two faculties.</p>

<p>This of course, makes the subject of transportation across faculties a very much important problem.
Logically one would suppose a university with this sort of logistical background, would accommodate students
fully, giving them access to day-round buses around the city, catered for the specific routes
on which the faculties fall on.</p>

<p>Well, As it so happens the main concern and on of the points of
arguments were Transportation.</p>

<p>Two of the main timeslots where students needed busses the most
were taken out, and hence people cared much about this issue.</p>

<h2>MM.. Food</h2>

<p>Food Sucks.</p>

<p>One would not think the food in a so called scientific establishment
could suck more than a low grade military barracks.</p>

<p>To add a top that, it is now more expensive than EVER! yippie.</p>

<p>of course people are not gonna <strong><em>buy</em></strong> that.</p>

<h2>Night of the dead</h2>

<p><img src="../pics/gatheraroundchildren.jpg" alt="gather around, children"  style="width:100%;height:auto;max-width:550px" /></p>

<p>Some Officials from the central office along with some from the
Ministry of Science make their way to dormitory yard.</p>

<p>The students gather them, chanting , some trying to guerrila-talk their way into showing their concerns and demands.</p>

<p>They suggest a sit down in the mosque , where they can hear the students better by them taking turn in talking.</p>

<p>Everyone knows fully by now, that granting them this, would officially mean granting them a position of high-to-low stance where they pick and choose what they want to hear and what and who to answer to.</p>

<p>Having said this the people just keep chanting, the officials move to the main faculty mosque, people outside still chanting.</p>

<p>Someone finally peeks into the mosque, what could the officials be doing that would be better than listening to the peoples demands?</p>

<ul>
<li>praying&hellip;.</li>
</ul>


<p>Yep, that&rsquo;s about the state of affairs here.</p>

<h2>They Always Crumble and Fall</h2>

<p>Off we Go!</p>

<p>I see Earth! It is so beautiful!</p>

<p>That night and all these nights, had one major result.</p>

<p>The two time slots most important to uni students , were put back in place.</p>

<p>Many issues remain untouched and untended.</p>

<p>But the greatest thing to notice :</p>

<p><strong><em>It works when people gather. *They truly don&rsquo;t have enough bullets</em></strong>*</p>
