<h1>The Snowing Hills Where Olives Trees Wither</h1>

<p><img src="../pics/olivetrees.png" alt="Where Olive Trees Olives Wither"  style="width:100%;height:auto;max-width:800px" /></p>

<p>Blasphemous is just one of those games that I couldn&rsquo;t help but to play.
It&rsquo;s a Metroidvania set in a realm called Cvstodia.
The visual theme is pretty much Andalucia pixelized into perfection.
I have always enjoyed playing 2D adventure games since I was a kid so Blasphemous was a no brainer.</p>

<h2>Blasphemous</h2>

<p><img src="../pics/silentsorrow.png" alt="Brohtherhood of the silent sorrow"  style="width:100%;height:auto;max-width:800px" /></p>

<p>The game takes place in Cvstodia.
&ldquo;The Miracle&rdquo; is a force existing in Cvstodia, Transforming everyone into grieving being by
making them suffer for their sins. Basically every creature in Cvstodia is atoning for their
sins and trying to seek penance.
The main character of the game is called the Penitent One, The last remaining member of the brotherhood of the silent sorrow.
His sword, forged from guilt itself, is called Mea Culpa. His goal is to
reach the &ldquo;Cradle of Affliction&rdquo;, and in order to do so he must complete the three
humiliations.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go into the plot of the game much in this blog post.</p>

<h2>Themes</h2>

<p><img src="../pics/convent.png" alt="Convent of Our Lady of The Charred Visage"  style="width:100%;height:auto;max-width:800px" /></p>

<p>The game explores a grim universe where everyone is at the mercy of
a seemingly evil force, called the Miracle. Almost all of the residents of Cvstodia
are in some way atoning for their sins, begging the miracle for mercy in various ways.
There is an extreme religious theme to the game, which just fits.
The gameplay constantly reminds the player of how unforgiving The Miracle is,
Since dying is not something that the game won&rsquo;t let happen often.
Almost everything has a melancholic vibe to it.
Rooms, mountains, enemies, friends, bosses and music, all of them are
grim and melancholic in design.</p>

<h2>Music</h2>

<p>The Blasphemous Soundtrack, The MUSIC, is out of this world.</p>

<p><a href="https://thegamekitchen.bandcamp.com/album/blasphemous">Arpegios en ocre</a> by Carlos Viola:</p>

<p><audio controls autoplay loop>
    <source src="../audio/ArpegiosEnOcre.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio></p>

<p>The music is composed by Carlos Viola, and perfectly matched the Andalusian
Vibe of the entire game.
The melancholic feeling to every second of every track just makes it perfect
for a game with this theme and also helps in creating an amazing atmosphere.</p>

<p>Even after completing the game, I listen to the Soundtrack frequently.</p>

<h2>What I Loved</h2>

<p><img src="../pics/isidora.png" alt="Isidora"  style="width:100%;height:auto;max-width:800px" /></p>

<p>Everything.</p>

<p>I always like to challenge myself while playing a video game.
There are a lot of challenging boss fights (and even enemies) in blasphemous, but the game
is also very fluent when it comes to gameplay and is just visually pleasing.</p>

<p>There is one boss fight in blasphemous that maybe took 50 consecutive for me tries to beat without taking damage, Isidora the voice of the dead; so yeah I enjoyed that a lot.</p>
