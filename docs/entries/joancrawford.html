<h1>The sky is filled with herds of shivering angels</h1>

<p>Blue Oyster Cult is just one of those classic rock bands who make music that one simply cannot deny
the impact and strange-ness of.</p>

<p>I came to know BOC 3 or so years ago with the song <em>I Love The Night</em>. In a gloomy autumn night it was
when I heard this song, many people resembling friends around me, not that any of them were not sincere, it
was just that I felt alone, and I had the right to, since no meaningful friendship was established.</p>

<p>Tavern night with strangers vibe.</p>

<p>Anyways;I hold Blue Oyster Cult as dear to me as almost the band Camel.</p>

<p>I have never been any good at giving convincing concise recommendations on music.
You just gotta listen to it.</p>

<p>Here are some of the songs I started out with :</p>

<ul>
<li>I Love The Night, Spectres Album</li>
<li>Astronomy*, Secret Treaties Album</li>
<li>Flaming Telepaths**, Secret Treaties Album</li>
<li>Joan Crawford, Fire of Unknown Origin Album</li>
<li>(Don&rsquo;t Fear) The Reaper, Agents of Fortune Album</li>
<li>The Vigil, Mirrors Album</li>
<li>Then Came the Last Days of May, Blue Oyster Cult Album</li>
</ul>


<p>In no particular order.</p>

<p><strong>*I highly recommend Astronomy cover by Metallica</strong></p>

<p><strong>** I highly recommend Flaming Telepaths cover by Witchwood</strong></p>

<p><strong>Anyways here is the lyrics to one I was just listening to (Joan Crawford):</strong></p>

<p>Junkies down in Brooklyn are going crazy</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re laughing, just like <a href="https://t.me/musicmakesmelosecontrol/1298">hungry dogs</a> in the street</p>

<p>Policemen are hidin' behind the skirts of little girls</p>

<p>Their eyes have turned the color of frozen meat</p>

<p>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no</p>

<p>Joan Crawford has risen from the grave</p>

<p>Joan Crawford has risen from the grave</p>

<p>Catholic school girls have thrown away their mascara</p>

<p>They chain themselves to the axles of Big Mack trucks</p>

<p>The sky is filled with herds of shivering angels</p>

<p>The fat lady laughs, &ldquo;Gentlemen, start your trucks&rdquo;</p>

<p>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no</p>

<p>Joan Crawford has risen from the grave</p>

<p>Joan Crawford has risen from the grave</p>

<p>no, no</p>

<p>(Christina) no, no, no, no, no</p>

<p>(Come to mother) no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no&hellip;</p>

<p>(Christina)</p>

<p>Joan Crawford has risen from the grave</p>

<p>Joan Crawford has risen from the grave</p>

<p>Joan Crawford has risen from the grave</p>

<p>Joan Crawford has risen from the grave</p>

<p>Joan Crawford has risen from the grave</p>

<p>Joan Crawford has risen from the grave</p>

<p>Joan Crawford has risen from the grave</p>

<p>Joan Crawford has risen</p>
