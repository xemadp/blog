<h1>Italian With Michel Thomas I</h1>

<hr>


<p><a href="https://emadp.xyz/entries/Spanish.html">Learning Spanish with Michel Thomas</a>
was a pleasant experience for
me even though I didn&rsquo;t go through the audio tracks as well as I
should have and ended up forgetting most of the Spanish I learned
because I didn&rsquo;t take keep on reading in Spanish and educating myself
enough. That was of course because of the certain events that happened
in my life at that time.
I had become disappointed in regards to learning Romance languages
after all, until my ambition for learning The Latin Languageâ„¢
prompted me to start again.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to learn Italian by the Michel Thomas method this time
because my ultimate goal is to learn Latin and I feel like Italian
would be a better gateway language to Latin.</p>

<h1>Why Latin</h1>

<hr>


<p><img src="../../pics/romanpepe.png" alt="Roman Pepe"  style="width:100%;height:auto;max-width:550px" /></p>

<p>I plan to write extensively about why Latin is worth
learning on my blog, so I will not elaborate too much here.
One of the reasons I feel like Latin is worth learning
is that many old philosophical and historically important
scientific works have first been compiled in Latin
and anyone who knows more than one language knows that
no matter what you do, information is lost in translation
almost like looking at a 2D projection of a 3D object and
trying to completely figure it out, it&rsquo;s simply not
descriptive enough.</p>

<p>But Latin has many more linguistic features that make it
superior for reading and writing in, going back to the
projection analogy, we humans cannot cannot visually perceive
a 4D object but using mathematics we can find out about
it&rsquo;s properties, Latin is mathematics in this case,
meaning it makes sense to write heavy scientific/philosophical
works in Latin since it can relay more information on a given
subject.</p>

<h1>Why Italian</h1>

<hr>

<p>Learning any romance language can be easy
if you already know English since many
English words are derived from romance languages.
Italian is the language of Italy, one could imagine
Italy as the modern day remains of the once existing
roman empire, and hence it is grammatically the closest
to Latin, of course the grammar of Latin is much more
comprehensive than that of Italian.
The vocabulary and the spelling of words in
Italian also mimic Latin closely.
Works of scientific importance in Italy are
also great gateway books into Latin works
because of the cultural likeness of them.</p>

<p>I am personally interested in the history and specially
in the mathematical discoveries made in Italy.
So it would be easier for me to learn Italian
hence I will do so.
The Cinema of Italy has always been very
touching for me (e.g: Pasolini )
I still have many great Italian movies to
watch and learning Italian after/alongside it will surely
prove to be beneficial.
Italian songs have also been in my playlists
since long ago, another reason for me to be biased
towards learning Italian.
Expect more blog posts about the Italian language as well.</p>

<h1>My Experience Learning Italian with Michel Thomas So Far</h1>

<hr>


<p>The Italian course using the Michel Thomas method seems
to be pretty similar to the Spanish one as far as learning
new vocabulary and making sentences go but it
seems to move to more complicated grammatical rules
faster than the Spanish one.
This time I am listening to the audio tracks
with better concentration and I have insight
on how to get the best out of a Michel Thomas
course, It looks more promising this time around
for me and I hope it stays that way.</p>
