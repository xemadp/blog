<h1>My university results are here!</h1>

<p>Almost a Month ago I got my national university entrance exam results and I had to apply to
different universities of my choice, basically how it works is that: one applies to as many
universities(alongside their majors) and lists them in order of priority, it goes through the list
and stops when it finds a choice that you qualify for ( based on your results and how you rank nationally)
I applied to multiple computer science spots with Tehran&rsquo;s universities as priorities in mind, about
2 weeks ago I got my results and I got accepted in KNTU( Khaje Nasir al-din Toosi University of technology in Tehran )
I was busy with signing up and getting my dormitory permit sorted out.
Last Friday ( 30th of September 2022 ) I came here to Tehran to settle in
My dormitory room.</p>

<p>Dorm life was strange the first few days, but I feel like I&rsquo;m habituating quick enough.
Getting the hang of where everything is was the hard part, obviously moving in with
total strangers isn&rsquo;t the best experience at first, but fortunately my roommates are not
the crazy type, in the end it worked out well ( so far ).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to the university experience, I don&rsquo;t necessarily know what to expect though.
I have a lot of discrete mathematics, which is exciting because I like discrete mathematics.</p>

<p>University students are going on strikes all across the country, I&rsquo;m not going to any
classes this week.</p>
