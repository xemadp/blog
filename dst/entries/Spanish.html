<h1>My Experience Learning Spanish with Michel Thomas</h1>

<p>About 3 weeks ago I decided It would be a good idea to pick up learning a new language in
summer since I have a excess amount of time to spare.I wanted to learn a new language and decided
to go with Spanish since Spanish is quite similar to English (vocabulary-wise), and also I&rsquo;ve
always wanted to learn Latin so I figured It&rsquo;s a good step towards getting more familiar with
romance languages.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Michel_Thomas">Michel Thomas</a> is a decorated WWII veteran who
developed his own language-teaching method, He kept this method a secret and only used it in
his own institute for the better part of his life, he believed that &ldquo;there are no bad students
only bad teachers&rdquo;. In early 2000s he decided to publish Educational Audio tracks on different
languages using his method.</p>

<p>His teaching method is strictly verbal and demands students not to write anything down
or take notes ( even mental notes!) he says that it&rsquo;s very important for students not to
try and &ldquo;remember&rdquo; taught material when they&rsquo;re not in class, Another requirement is that
the student must be &ldquo;relaxed&rdquo; and away from the sensation of &ldquo;being stressed to learn something&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I was looking around for material to learn Spanish, I had in mind the fact
that most language &ldquo;learning&rdquo; materials really don&rsquo;t teach you languages the way
they&rsquo;re supposed to be taught since native speakers learn languages mostly by listening
and communicating and there&rsquo;s really no hierarchical process when learning a language,
that is precisely how I learned English and My English skills seem to be way better than
that of my most peers.</p>

<p>Having that in mind I decided to give Michel Thomas tapes a chance, Although to be completely
honest At first it came across as a scam since the pdf file included along with the tapes kept
on promising unreal results and also boasted a lot about some mysterious learning method that
has been in the dark for the longest time and has educated lots and lots of Wealthy Actors and
Senators, but since the entire Spanish course was about 8 hours I decided to give it a try.</p>

<p><img src="../pics/waltespanol.jpg" alt=""  style="width:100%;height:auto;max-width:720px" /></p>

<p>And I was so wrong about my conception of what <em>The Michel Thomas Experienceâ„¢</em> was going to be
like. The tapes are basically Michel Thomas, and two students in a room together. Michel teaches
something basic and asks the students to use it in a sentence for example he would say: &ldquo; Tengo means I have, Lo means it, Lo tengo means I have it and Los means them, So what would I have them be?&rdquo;
and the students will try and come up with the proper Spanish Sentence. And That&rsquo;s basically how
the entire course is. He gives the students a good grasp on how the language really works and
wants them to come up with the sentences themselves, he never really gives the student the complete
sentence, they have to come up with it themselves.</p>

<p>One enjoyable thing about Michel is that he knows exactly the extend of what he has taught his
students, he might mention something once and proceed and then he will ask about it 4 hours
Later(in the course).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to about 5 or 6 tapes everyday for the past 3 weeks and I feel Like I have
a good understanding of how sentences are constructed in Spanish and I can put sentences together
as If I &ldquo;Know&rdquo; how to speak Spanish, and that&rsquo;s exactly how you want to feel, I see a lot of people
who claim they are &ldquo;learning&rdquo; a language but very clearly seem to be translating when they attempt
to put words together which is a major SIN!</p>

<p>Anyways I recommend you look at the Michel Thomas Tapes if you ever want to learn a new language
although I&rsquo;ve heard the courses in which Michel Thomas is not present differ majorly from his way
of teaching even though I haven&rsquo;t listened to them myself I don&rsquo;t recommend you getting them since
it&rsquo;s not really the Michel Thomas Method.</p>
