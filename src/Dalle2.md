# I got invited to create with DALLE2
A couple of month ago when DALLE2 was exciting news I requested to join OpenAI's waitlist 
to use DALLE2 ( This was of course before the low-tier dollar store variation of it became available to 
everyone for free)

(not) *Surprisingly* OpenAI had to kill my vibe right off the bat by not letting me sign up using My Country's IP,
There's a workaround for that ( VPNS ) so I didn't care much until it asked me for my number for 2FA
That was a problem considering I didn't have A number from some foreign country so I ended up Asking a 
friend Abroad to let me use his number and after all that fuss I was given permission to create with 
DALLE2, *Only 50 prompts though!*

I realized they had made a "Credit" system where each credit amounted to one prompt and after that you 
could *buy new credit* or wait another month for 15 free credits! Yeah so that was a bit underwhelming...
But I didn't care much since 50 prompts were enough for my usage.

It took me a couple of tries to figure out exactly how to write prompts in order to produce outputs close to
what I had in mind. Afterwards it was pretty standard DALLE experience so I decided to share some of the images here. One of the variation of prompts that resulted in interesting creations was "Ornate Persian
/Mughal/Ottoman Miniature depicting X"

I got some really unexpected results from a couple of prompts so  I'm not even gonna write the prompts here, just let your imagination go wild with these ones:

And that's the end of this blog post.

P.S: This was more like a collection of my DALLE2 creations 
but I still felt like putting it in a blog post, sorry for the heavy webpage!
