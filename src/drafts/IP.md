# How They Exploit Us
You hear the words IP ( Intellectual Property ) A lot these
days. Big companies and law firms use this definition to set rules
that are totally disrespectful of the rights of ordinary people.

The term IP implies that, that particular thing, be it a digital version
of a song, a movie, or a piece of software is in fact some sort of PROPERTY, when Europeans came
to the Americas, The Natives had no clue what the meaning of property was,
When the white man proposed to buy Manhattan from the natives, they thought
the idea of someone owning land as property was so bizarre that they wanted
to sell the sky as well! 

The relationship between us and the big firms/companies
is not so different from that of the white man and natives,
it is similar in the sense that we really don't fathom the 
idea of IP because the reality is so bizarre that it doesn't
really make sense to us, normally we wouldn't accept such things
as patents and trade secretes, if we knew what those terms really entailed 
for us.

The Confusing nature of the term Property makes it so that
A lot of people can be exploited.
In my opinion the most important feature of anything that
is considered Property is that it must be physically tangible
meaning for example if you take a random carton of milk out of
a supermarket without paying for it, the physical tangibility 
of that carton of milk elicit that the store owner has now 
suffered meaningful physical damage, meaning he now has one 
less carton of milk in supply, meaning he will not make enough
money to equally benefit and buy the same carton of milk next month etc, etc.

Let's consider for a moment a movie that was made in 2013, the current 
copyright law tells us that we have to wait for "the creator" to die plus
70 years to be able to "lawfully" redistribute the movie amongst ourselves,
anything that isn't that is unlawful and criminal.

It all seems to me that this definition is set in place for people
with specific attributions to make money, what are these attributions 
you ask? Well it seems the more you are inclined to like usury, theft and
making money without actually doing anything meaningful, this system 
would help you out better, consider Sony after the death of Michael Jackson 
( and even before that !), just how much money do you think a company like
Sony makes leeching off of the products of dead artists? 

Now to be perfectly honest I'm not saying that we should get rid of the IP
completely, I'm just presenting how the many confusing parts in the definition of IP
are used to bleed hard working people and benefit the big companies who make money
for the sake of existing, when unrealistic laws like the one mentioned above are set,
many rights are taken away from us, and much like the Native-Americans,
Many of us don't really think ( or want to think ) how this effects us or maybe grasp the entire 
idea behind these laws, we are being bled dry from our rights and we don't even
fight back slightly for them.

## Pirates!
To call those who harmlessly copy files and share them within some community
the same thing you call savage thieves who raid normal ships and steal everything,
truly shows the mental image they are trying to relay here, what they are basically saying 
is that if you copy a file "unlawfully", what you have done
amounts to about the same as, setting an entire ship full of harmless people
on fire and stealing everything they have got.
Despite their efforts though the term pirate has been embraced by the community, 
although it should never be forgotten where this word comes from.

## A couple of examples

### Trademarks
What they are telling you in essence is that, someone could own a word
and nothing stops them from demanding money from you just to use it, it's 
just that they still haven't found a way to justify that.

### Trade secrets And Patents
Basically what trade secrets are for is that,
let's say a company like Intel is the only company 
that is authorized to make the most used computer architecture (ISA)
meaning if anyone else, could somehow through the means of reverse engineering,
find a way to meaningfully manufacture the same computer architectures,
they would be sued to hell by Intel, because they own the patent for that
instruction set itself, so only they are allowed to create the CPUs,
on which the entire infrastructure of computing is based.
Meaning that if one day, Intel , for ANY reason, decided that it would
be a good idea to introduce a unit next to our CPUs that has kernel level
access to our computers, they could do so,and [they do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine), 
and no one would be able to
say a thing because we need them, because they are effectively embedded in
our infrastructure. 
Now you tell me, doesn't it seem kind of malicious the way
all of these laws and terms are defined? It sure seems to me that
the definitions of terms like Trade Secretes and Patents and IP in general
can be easily used by major companies to seamlessly exploit us and there is 
effectively nothing we can do about it, unless we somehow realize and fight 
for the transformations of these laws and definitions themselves.
